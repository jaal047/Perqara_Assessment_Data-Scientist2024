This repository contains the code and documentation for an assessment project aimed at analyzing and predicting customer behavior using e-commerce data. The project involves data preparation, exploratory data analysis, customer segmentation, and churn prediction modeling.

## Project Structure

- **About Data**: An overview of the dataset used for analysis, which includes customer, order, geolocation, seller, and product data from an e-commerce platform in Brazil.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis**:
  - **Order Exploration**: Analysis of order data to uncover trends, peak times, and customer behavior patterns.
  - **Geolocation Exploration**: A geographical analysis of orders, highlighting the regions with the most e-commerce activity.
  - **Sales Exploration**: Evaluation of sales data over time, including seasonal trends and fluctuations in shipping costs.

- **Customer Review Analysis (NLP)**:
  - **Sentiment Analysis**: Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques were used to analyze customer reviews, identifying key positive and negative sentiments.
  - **WordCloud Visualization**: WordClouds were generated to visualize the most common words in positive and negative reviews.

- **Customer Segmentation (RFM)**:
  - **RFM Segmentation**: Customers were segmented based on Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) analysis. This helps in identifying valuable customers and those at risk of churning.
  - **Segment Distribution**: Visualization of customer segments, highlighting key segments such as Champions, Loyal Customers, and At Risk customers.

- **Churn Prediction Model**:
  - **Feature Engineering**: Data preparation steps include handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and feature scaling.
  - **Imbalanced Data Handling**: Techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) were used to address class imbalance in the target variable.
  - **Model Building**: Various machine learning models were trained and evaluated, including Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Logistic Regression.
  - **Model Evaluation**: The performance of the models was assessed using metrics like accuracy, recall, and confusion matrices.

## Conclusion

The analysis and models developed in this project provide valuable insights into customer behavior and can help e-commerce platforms reduce churn and enhance customer retention strategies.
